# Online Double Oracle: From Normal-Form to Extensive-Form Games

This repository is the implementation of Extensive-Form Online Double Oracle

> Online Double Oracle (ODO) is a new learning algorithm for two-player zero-sum games where the number of pure strategies is huge or even infinite. Specifically, we combine no-regret analysis from online learning with double oracle methods from game theory. ODO achieves the regret bound <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}&space;O(\sqrt{Tklog(k)})&space;" title="O(\sqrt{Tklog(k)}) " /> with k being the size of the effective strategy set which is linearly dependent on the support size of Nash equilibrium. Our method can be efficiently extended to extensive form games in which Extensive ODO (XODO). In extensive form game such as Kuhn Poker,Oshi Zumo and a variant of Leduc Poker, XODO shows state-of-the-art performance interms of convergence rate to the Nash Equilibrium.
